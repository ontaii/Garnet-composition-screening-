1. Screen.py is the main program.
2. Screen.py operates with the "input.txt" file, which contains candidate cations for the A3, B2, and C3 sites.
3. You can customize the contents of the "input.txt" file to meet your specific requirements. It can include more or fewer cations. However, be cautious not to include too many cations, as it may significantly increase the screening time. Here's an example format:
-------------
A = Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+
B = Mg2+, Zn2+, Al3+
C = Li+, Mg2+, Zn2+
-------------
In the example above:
    3.1. Ensure that cations have valences (e.g., Ca2+ is correct, but Ca is not).
    3.2. Separate cations with a comma "," and a space.
    3.3. Do not include anything at the end of a row (e.g., "A = Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+" is correct, but "A = Ca2+, Sr2+, Ba2+," is not).
